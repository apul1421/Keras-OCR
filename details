2. Measure of Success
a. OCR Success Methodology

The success of the OCR tool will be evaluated using a structured approach. The accuracy is determined by the OCR’s ability to extract relevant fields accurately.

Success Score:

Success Score
=
(
Number of Correctly Extracted Fields
Total Number of Fields
)
×
100
Success Score=( 
Total Number of Fields
Number of Correctly Extracted Fields
​
 )×100
Threshold: A score greater than 20% is considered acceptable for basic validation, ensuring that the OCR tool extracts essential information effectively. This threshold will be adjusted over time based on quality control and data analysis.

b. RAG (Red-Amber-Green) Metrics

Green: Success score of 80% or above – OCR performance is excellent, with minimal manual intervention required.
Amber: Success score between 50%-79% – OCR performance is moderate, requiring some manual checks.
Red: Success score below 50% – OCR performance is poor, necessitating a full manual review.
3. Stages of Solution
The OCR framework will follow these solution stages:

a. Extraction

The OCR tool will extract data from documents in a standardized tabular format to facilitate easy analysis. This includes parsing information from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured documents.

Provide some more statistical methodologies for OCR validation 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here are some additional statistical methodologies that can be incorporated to validate OCR accuracy and performance:

1. Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
Precision: Measures the percentage of correctly extracted fields out of all fields identified by the OCR tool.

Precision
=
True Positives
True Positives
+
False Positives
Precision= 
True Positives+False Positives
True Positives
​
 
Recall: Measures the percentage of relevant fields extracted by the OCR tool out of the total fields available in the document.

Recall
=
True Positives
True Positives
+
False Negatives
Recall= 
True Positives+False Negatives
True Positives
​
 
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced metric that considers both false positives and false negatives.

F1 Score
=
2
×
Precision
×
Recall
Precision
+
Recall
F1 Score=2× 
Precision+Recall
Precision×Recall
​
 
These metrics are particularly useful for evaluating how well the OCR tool identifies and extracts relevant data without introducing errors.

2. Character Error Rate (CER)
CER measures the percentage of characters that are incorrectly recognized by the OCR tool. It is calculated as follows:

CER
=
Number of Insertions + Substitutions + Deletions
Total Number of Characters
CER= 
Total Number of Characters
Number of Insertions + Substitutions + Deletions
​
 
Lower CER indicates higher accuracy at the character level, making it useful for evaluating OCR performance on text-heavy documents, such as contracts and letters.

3. Word Error Rate (WER)
Similar to CER, Word Error Rate (WER) evaluates errors at the word level instead of the character level, making it suitable for documents where full words are critical for validation (e.g., names, addresses).

WER
=
Number of Insertions + Substitutions + Deletions
Total Number of Words
WER= 
Total Number of Words
Number of Insertions + Substitutions + Deletions
​
 
4. Field Accuracy Rate (FAR)
Field Accuracy Rate assesses the correctness of individual fields extracted from documents. This metric is valuable when documents contain specific fields that need to be accurately extracted, such as names, dates, and financial figures.

Field Accuracy Rate
=
Correctly Extracted Fields
Total Number of Fields
Field Accuracy Rate= 
Total Number of Fields
Correctly Extracted Fields
​
 
5. Confidence Interval Analysis
For each extracted field, the OCR tool often provides a confidence score. Statistical analysis can be done by aggregating confidence scores across documents, allowing for:

Average Confidence Score: An overall average confidence score across all documents.
Confidence Intervals: Calculate intervals (e.g., 95%) to understand the certainty levels in the OCR’s accuracy.
Documents or fields with confidence scores below a certain threshold can be flagged for manual review.

6. Levenshtein Distance
Levenshtein distance calculates the number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change an OCR output string to the ground-truth string. Lower Levenshtein distances indicate higher accuracy.

Average Levenshtein Distance: An average score across all fields in the document can provide insight into the OCR accuracy.
Normalized Levenshtein Distance: The distance can also be normalized by dividing by the length of the ground-truth string, especially for documents with variable field lengths.
7. False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR)
False Positive Rate (FPR): Measures the proportion of incorrectly identified fields out of all non-existent fields.

FPR
=
False Positives
False Positives
+
True Negatives
FPR= 
False Positives+True Negatives
False Positives
​
 
False Negative Rate (FNR): Measures the proportion of missed relevant fields out of all relevant fields.

FNR
=
False Negatives
True Positives
+
False Negatives
FNR= 
True Positives+False Negatives
False Negatives
​
 
Both metrics can help identify where the OCR model may be overly aggressive or conservative in recognizing fields.

8. Per-Field Comparison Metrics
For documents where specific fields have different importance, a weighted accuracy can be applied:

Weighted Accuracy Score: Assign different weights to fields based on their importance and evaluate a combined accuracy score.
Weighted Accuracy
=
∑
(
Field Accuracy
×
Field Weight
)
Weighted Accuracy=∑(Field Accuracy×Field Weight)
This can be helpful in underwriting, where fields like income or identification number may be more critical than others.

9. Document Consistency Check
Cross-Field Consistency: Validates logical relationships between fields (e.g., birth date should not be a future date, income should match employment status).
Outlier Detection: Detects extreme or unusual values in fields (e.g., unusually high income values) that may indicate OCR errors. Statistical methods like Z-scores can help in identifying these outliers.
10. Regression Analysis on Confidence Scores and Error Rates
Conduct a regression analysis between confidence scores and error rates to analyze the correlation. This can help establish confidence score thresholds where the OCR output is likely to be accurate, potentially reducing the manual review workload.

11. Error Distribution Analysis
Understanding where errors occur most frequently is crucial for targeted improvements. Error distribution analysis involves:

By Document Type: Analyzing accuracy across different document categories (ID, Address, Income) to identify weaker areas.
By Field Type: Measuring error rates for each field (e.g., Name, Date of Birth, Income) to identify specific fields that need improvement.
By Document Quality: Comparing performance across Easy, Medium, and Hard documents.
12. Time-Series Analysis for Model Drift Detection
For an OCR system running in production, it’s important to monitor performance over time to detect model drift. Time-series analysis on accuracy scores, error rates, and confidence scores can highlight periods where the OCR performance deviates, potentially signaling the need for retraining or updates.

These methodologies offer a comprehensive approach to validating and fine-tuning OCR accuracy, reliability, and suitability for underwriting applications. Combining these metrics provides a robust understanding of OCR performance across different document types, fields, and quality levels.

Please provide some stastical method to classify a document based on the quality
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Classifying a document's quality can be done using various statistical methods that assess features like readability, structure, noise, and OCR performance. Here are some approaches for classifying document quality (Easy, Medium, Hard):

1. Feature Extraction for Document Quality Assessment
Before applying statistical methods, the following features can be extracted:

Structural Features: Number of lines, paragraphs, images, or tables in the document.
Text Density: Ratio of textual content to the overall area of the document.
Noise Features: Presence of smudges, skew, stains, or low resolution.
Font Features: Variability in font size, style, or spacing.
Image Features: Quality of scanned images, measured by resolution or blurriness.
2. Statistical Methods
A. Threshold-Based Classification
Calculate numerical thresholds for extracted features (e.g., resolution, noise level) and classify documents based on rules.
Example thresholds:
Easy: Resolution > 300 DPI, Noise Level < 10%, Text Content > 90%.
Medium: Resolution 150-300 DPI, Moderate Noise (10%-30%).
Hard: Resolution < 150 DPI, Noise > 30%, Text Content < 50%.
Use histograms or boxplots to determine feature distributions and define thresholds.
B. Logistic Regression
Logistic regression can predict document quality (Easy, Medium, Hard) based on extracted features:

Dependent Variable: Document Quality (categorical: Easy = 1, Medium = 2, Hard = 3).
Independent Variables:
Text Density
Resolution (DPI)
Noise Ratio
OCR Confidence Scores
Output: A probability score for each quality category.
C. K-Means Clustering
Use unsupervised learning to group documents into quality categories:

Input features: Text density, noise ratio, OCR confidence, and resolution.
Clustering will divide documents into 3 clusters (Easy, Medium, Hard).
Interpret clusters using feature averages:
Cluster 1: High resolution, low noise → Easy.
Cluster 2: Moderate resolution and noise → Medium.
Cluster 3: Low resolution, high noise → Hard.
D. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Use PCA to reduce dimensionality of document features and visualize quality classifications.
Analyze feature importance in explaining variance and create thresholds in reduced dimensions to classify documents.
E. Decision Tree Classification
Build a decision tree to classify documents:

Inputs: Extracted features like text density, resolution, noise, and OCR confidence.
Outputs: Document quality labels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
Example rules:
If Resolution > 300 DPI and Noise < 10% → Easy.
If Resolution between 150-300 DPI and OCR Confidence > 70% → Medium.
If Resolution < 150 DPI or Noise > 30% → Hard.
F. Random Forest Classification
Extend decision trees to a Random Forest model for higher accuracy and generalizability.
Features like OCR success rate, text-to-noise ratio, and blurriness are used as predictors.
Output: Probabilities for each quality level.
G. Naive Bayes Classification
Calculate the probability of document quality levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) based on features.
Formula:
𝑃

P(Q∣F)= 
P(F)
P(F∣Q)⋅P(Q)
​
 
Where:
𝑄
Q: Document Quality.
𝐹
F: Features (resolution, noise level, text density, etc.).
Use prior probabilities (e.g., 50% of documents are Easy, 30% Medium, and 20% Hard) and likelihoods based on feature distributions.
H. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Map features into a high-dimensional space and classify document quality using a linear or non-linear boundary.
Example kernel functions:
Linear: For clear separation between Easy, Medium, and Hard.
RBF: For complex, non-linear separations.
3. Performance Metrics for Classification
Once a statistical model is applied, use the following metrics to evaluate classification performance:

Accuracy: Percentage of documents correctly classified.
Confusion Matrix: Analyze false positives and negatives for each category.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Measure per-category performance.
ROC Curve: For binary classification (e.g., Easy vs. Not Easy), assess true positive rate vs. false positive rate.
4. Example Use Case
Dataset:
Documents: ID cards, contracts, utility bills, handwritten forms.
Features: OCR Confidence (70%-95%), Noise Ratio (5%-40%), Resolution (100-600 DPI).
Approach:
Use K-Means Clustering for initial segmentation into 3 clusters.
Train a Logistic Regression model with labeled data.
Fine-tune using Random Forest for better generalization.
Validate using Precision, Recall, and Accuracy metrics.

How to extract features ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Extracting features from documents for classification involves processing and analyzing the content, structure, and metadata of the document. Below are the steps and techniques you can use to extract relevant features for document quality assessment:

1. Preprocessing the Document
Before feature extraction, preprocess the document to ensure compatibility for analysis:

OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Convert scanned images or PDFs into text using OCR tools like Tesseract, Google Cloud Vision, or AWS Textract.
Image Processing: For scanned images, apply techniques such as:
Deskewing: Correct document alignment.
Denoising: Reduce noise (e.g., Gaussian or median filters).
Thresholding: Convert grayscale to binary for better analysis.
2. Feature Categories
Here are key feature categories and methods to extract them:

A. Structural Features
Text Density:
Calculate the ratio of text content (character count or word count) to the overall document size (height × width in pixels).
Formula:
Text Density
=
Text Area
Document Area
Text Density= 
Document Area
Text Area
​
 
Tools: Use OCR to extract text and OpenCV for document size analysis.
Number of Lines and Paragraphs:
Count the number of lines or paragraphs detected by OCR.
Presence of Tables/Images:
Use image segmentation techniques (OpenCV, PyTesseract) to detect non-textual regions.
For example, contours in OpenCV can identify table grids.
B. Text Features
Font Features:
Detect font size, style (bold, italic), and spacing consistency using OCR or PDF metadata.
Identify variability in fonts, which may indicate harder document formats.
Character Error Rate (CER):
Compare OCR output against ground truth for a document to measure recognition errors.
Word Count:
Total words extracted via OCR.
Language Detection:
Use tools like langdetect or TextBlob to identify language consistency.
C. Image Features
Resolution (DPI):
Extract from document metadata or calculate by analyzing the pixel count and physical dimensions.
Noise Ratio:
Measure the ratio of noise pixels to total pixels using image processing techniques:
Use edge detection (e.g., Canny) to identify smudges or distorted edges.
Count pixels that deviate from uniform backgrounds.
Blurriness:
Apply the Laplacian variance method to assess the sharpness of the image:
Blurriness
=
Variance of Laplacian(image)
Blurriness=Variance of Laplacian(image)
Lower variance indicates a blurrier document.
D. OCR-Specific Features
Confidence Scores:
Most OCR tools like Tesseract, AWS Textract, or Google Vision provide confidence scores for recognized text.
Aggregate confidence scores for the entire document (e.g., average, median).
Field-Level Extraction:
Check for the presence and accuracy of fields like "Name," "Address," "Date," etc.
Compare extracted fields against templates or patterns (e.g., regex for dates).
Word Alignment:
Measure if words are aligned correctly (e.g., horizontal text vs. skewed or tilted text).
E. Document Layout Features
Alignment:
Use Hough Line Transform (OpenCV) to check text alignment and detect skew.
Margins:
Measure space between the content and the edges of the document.
Whitespace Ratio:
Calculate the ratio of blank regions to text-filled regions. High whitespace ratios may indicate blank or improperly scanned documents.
3. Tools for Feature Extraction
Python Libraries
Tesseract OCR: For extracting text and confidence scores.
OpenCV: For image analysis, noise detection, and layout analysis.
PyPDF2/FitPDF: For extracting metadata and structure from PDF documents.
scikit-image: For image preprocessing and feature extraction.

4. Example Implementation in Python
Extract Text Density and Noise Ratio
python
Copy code
import cv2
import pytesseract
import numpy as np

# Load the document image
image = cv2.imread("document.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply OCR to extract text
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
text_area = len(text)  # Total number of characters

# Calculate the document area
height, width = image.shape
doc_area = height * width

# Text Density
text_density = text_area / doc_area

# Calculate Noise Ratio
_, binary_image = cv2.threshold(image, 128, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
noise_pixels = cv2.countNonZero(cv2.bitwise_not(binary_image))

How to get confidence score for the OCR inside LLM like ChatGPT 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Getting OCR confidence scores directly from a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT is not possible because LLMs do not perform OCR themselves; they rely on text input (e.g., from an OCR tool). Instead, you can integrate an OCR tool (e.g., Tesseract, Google Vision API, AWS Textract) to perform the OCR process and obtain confidence scores, which you can then feed into an LLM for further processing or reasoning.

Steps to Combine OCR Confidence Scores with LLMs
1. Use an OCR Tool for Feature Extraction
To extract OCR confidence scores, use a dedicated OCR tool, as LLMs don't process raw images. Here's how:

Using Tesseract (Python Example)
python
Copy code
import pytesseract
import cv2

# Load the document image
image = cv2.imread("document.jpg", cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Apply OCR with Tesseract
ocr_data = pytesseract.image_to_data(image, output_type=pytesseract.Output.DICT)

# Extract confidence scores for each recognized word
confidence_scores = [int(conf) for conf in ocr_data['conf'] if conf != '-1']

# Calculate average confidence score
average_confidence = sum(confidence_scores) / len(confidence_scores)
print(f"Average OCR Confidence: {average_confidence}")
Other OCR tools like Google Cloud Vision API or AWS Textract also provide word-level or field-level confidence scores.

2. Pass OCR Data to ChatGPT or LLM
Once OCR text and confidence scores are extracted, format them as structured input for the LLM. This allows the LLM to perform further validation, reasoning, or categorization.

Example Input for LLM
yaml
Copy code
Extracted Text:
Name: John Doe
Address: 123 Elm Street, Springfield

OCR Confidence Scores:
- Name field: 92%
- Address field: 85%
Average Confidence: 88.5%

Task:
Classify the document as High, Medium, or Low quality based on OCR confidence.
3. Use Generative AI for Validation
Feed the OCR data and confidence scores into an LLM (like ChatGPT) to perform logical validation or generate insights. Example prompts could include:

Prompt 1: Document Quality Analysis
yaml
Copy code
Based on the OCR confidence scores below, classify the document quality:
- Name field: 92%
- Address field: 85%
- Other fields: 70%

Thresholds:
- High quality: All fields > 90%.
- Medium quality: Most fields > 75%.
- Low quality: Fields < 75%.

What is the quality of this document?
Prompt 2: Highlight Potential Issues
yaml
Copy code
Analyze the OCR results and provide suggestions for improving the document quality:
- Text extracted: "Jhn Dne"
- Confidence Scores: 50%, 60%, 70%.
What could be causing these issues? How can we fix them?
4. Enhancing LLM Output with Confidence Scores
If you're building a system, you can:

Use an API wrapper to integrate LLMs and OCR tools.
Pre-process the confidence scores and format them as structured input before querying the LLM.
3rd-Party OCR APIs with Confidence Support
Google Vision API:
Provides confidence scores for text blocks, paragraphs, words, and symbols.
API Documentation
AWS Textract:
Extracts confidence scores for structured forms and text fields.
API Documentation
Microsoft Azure Computer Vision:
Provides OCR capabilities with bounding box and confidence scores.
API Documentation
Example API Output for Google Vision:

json
Copy code
{
  "description": "John Doe",
  "confidence": 0.92
}
5. Automating the Process
Step 1: Extract OCR text and confidence scores using an OCR API or library.
Step 2: Preprocess the OCR output for structured input (e.g., JSON or tabular format).
Step 3: Feed the preprocessed data into the LLM for reasoning, validation, or summarization.
By combining OCR confidence scores and ChatGPT's reasoning capabilities, you can build a robust pipeline for document classification, validation, and quality analysis.

How does ChatGPT extract data from the image 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
ChatGPT itself cannot directly process or extract data from images. However, OpenAI has other models, such as OpenAI Vision (available in tools like GPT-4 Vision), which can analyze images and provide descriptions, text extraction, and reasoning based on the content of the image. Here's how data extraction typically works:

1. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for Text Extraction
For image-to-text tasks, tools like GPT-4 Vision use OCR technology to extract text from an image. The process involves:

Preprocessing the Image: Enhancing image quality (e.g., resizing, denoising).
Detecting Text Regions: Identifying areas in the image likely to contain text.
Recognizing Characters: Using a model trained to convert detected regions into digital text.
For example:

If you upload an image of a document to GPT-4 Vision, it uses an OCR engine embedded in the model to detect and extract text, similar to standalone OCR tools like Tesseract, Google Vision API, or AWS Textract.
2. How GPT-4 Vision Works
When GPT-4 Vision analyzes an image, it can:

Extract Text: Recognize and transcribe text present in the image.
Identify Context: Understand the image's content, layout, and structure.
Reasoning Over Data: Analyze and draw conclusions from the extracted text, such as interpreting document types, summarizing content, or identifying anomalies.
For instance:

A receipt uploaded to GPT-4 Vision could result in:
bash
Copy code
Item 1: Milk - $2.50
Item 2: Bread - $1.00
Total: $3.50
3. Tools Behind the Scenes
While GPT-4 Vision handles images, it relies on various steps under the hood:

Image Processing:

Detect key elements in the image like tables, forms, text regions, and images.
Use deep learning models trained on image datasets for accurate interpretation.
Text Recognition:

OCR processes extract text from detected regions with high accuracy, handling structured (e.g., tables) and unstructured (e.g., handwritten notes) data.
Text-to-Context Conversion:

Once the text is extracted, GPT-4 uses its language model capabilities to analyze and understand the context of the extracted data.
4. Typical Limitations
Image Quality: Blurry or noisy images may result in poor text extraction.
Complex Layouts: Complicated tables, overlapping text, or unusual layouts may reduce accuracy.
Handwriting: While some OCR tools can recognize handwritten text, accuracy is lower than for printed text.
5. How You Can Use OCR with ChatGPT
If you want to extract data from an image using ChatGPT in combination with OCR:

Use an external OCR tool (e.g., Tesseract, Google Vision API, or AWS Textract) to extract the text from the image.
Provide the extracted text as input to ChatGPT for further processing, reasoning, or summarization.
For example:

Extract text with Tesseract:
python
Copy code
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# Load the image
image = Image.open("document.jpg")

# Extract text using Tesseract
extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

print(extracted_text)
Send text to ChatGPT for validation or summarization:
vbnet
Copy code
Input: Summarize the following text extracted from an image: "Invoice: Total $100, Date: 2024-11-20."
Summary
ChatGPT (or GPT-4 Vision) analyzes images with OCR technology to extract text.
For use cases involving text-heavy images, OCR engines convert image data into text before feeding it into an LLM like ChatGPT for further analysis.
When ChatGPT is used without Vision capabilities, external OCR tools must be used to extract data before processing.

How to calculate ChatGPT 4 vision confidence score  
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
GPT-4 Vision does not provide explicit confidence scores for its outputs because it functions as a general-purpose AI that generates natural language descriptions or structured outputs based on image inputs. Unlike traditional OCR tools (like Tesseract, Google Vision API, or AWS Textract) that provide field-specific confidence scores, GPT-4 Vision relies on deep learning inference and does not assign probabilities or explicit confidence levels to its predictions.

However, you can estimate or calculate a confidence-like measure for GPT-4 Vision's outputs indirectly. Below are some methods you can use to approximate a confidence score or validate its outputs:

1. Heuristic-Based Confidence Estimation
You can evaluate GPT-4 Vision's output quality by cross-referencing its predictions with predefined criteria or metrics. Examples include:

Text Accuracy: Compare extracted text against a ground truth, if available.
Expected Format Check: Ensure the output adheres to the expected format (e.g., dates, numeric values).
Completeness: Measure if all expected fields are present and extracted correctly.
Example Workflow:

Upload an image of a document (e.g., an invoice).
Check if fields like "Invoice Number," "Date," and "Total Amount" are extracted.
Assign a confidence score based on the number of correct fields:
Confidence
=
Number of Correct Fields Extracted
Total Expected Fields
×
100
Confidence= 
Total Expected Fields
Number of Correct Fields Extracted
​
 ×100
2. Statistical Matching with External Tools
You can compare GPT-4 Vision's output with results from a traditional OCR tool (e.g., Google Vision, AWS Textract) that provides explicit confidence scores. If both tools produce similar results, you can infer higher confidence in GPT-4 Vision's output.

Steps:

Use an external OCR tool to process the image and extract text with confidence scores.
Compare the extracted text from GPT-4 Vision with the external tool’s results.
Assign a composite confidence score based on the similarity of outputs.
3. Text Entropy or Ambiguity Analysis
To calculate an implicit confidence score, you can analyze the consistency and clarity of the text extracted by GPT-4 Vision:

Lower Entropy: Indicates more confident predictions (e.g., clear text with fewer ambiguities).
Higher Entropy: Suggests uncertain predictions (e.g., ambiguous or inconsistent outputs).
This can be done programmatically by:

Counting ambiguous terms like "unclear," "possibly," or incomplete data in the output.
Reducing confidence based on detected ambiguities.
Example Scoring Heuristic: Assign confidence:

100% for precise and unambiguous text.
80-90% if a few ambiguities are present.
Below 50% if text appears incomplete or heavily ambiguous.
4. Domain-Specific Validation
If the extracted data belongs to a specific domain (e.g., invoices, forms, ID cards), you can validate GPT-4 Vision's output against business rules. For example:

If the image is an invoice, check if numerical values add up correctly.
If it’s an ID card, validate fields like "Name" or "Date of Birth" against known data formats.

5. Ensemble Approach
For a more robust confidence score, combine GPT-4 Vision with other AI tools (e.g., traditional OCR engines) and use an ensemble approach:

Run the image through multiple OCR systems (including GPT-4 Vision).
Compare the outputs for consistency across tools.
Higher agreement among tools indicates higher confidence.
6. Output Consistency via Re-Prompting
GPT-4 Vision can be re-prompted with the same or similar image to check the consistency of its outputs. If multiple runs produce similar results, you can infer higher confidence in the response.

Steps:

Provide the same image multiple times.
Compare responses for consistency.
Higher consistency suggests higher confidence.
7. Use Probabilistic Models
If paired with a structured OCR tool, confidence can be modeled probabilistically:

Treat the LLM's ability to generate accurate responses as a probabilistic event.
Use Bayesian analysis to
